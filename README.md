üé• Text-to-Video Generator Streamlit App
========================================

This is a simple yet powerful web application built with Streamlit that allows you to generate short videos from text prompts using the state-of-the-art Damo-VILAB Text-to-Video Diffusion Model.

‚ú® Features
----------

-   Text-to-Video Generation: Convert descriptive text prompts into dynamic video clips.

-   Intuitive UI: Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

-   Video Playback: Directly view generated videos within the application.

-   Download Option: Download your generated videos for offline use.

-   GPU Accelerated: Leverages CUDA for faster video generation (requires compatible NVIDIA GPU).

üöÄ Prerequisites
----------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Python 3.8+: Recommended version.

-   pip: Python package installer.

-   NVIDIA GPU (CUDA Compatible): Highly recommended for performance. The model runs on `torch.float16` and is moved to `"cuda"`, so a GPU is essential for practical use. Without a GPU, generation will be extremely slow or may not work due to memory constraints.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
----------------

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1.  Clone the Repository (or save the code):

    If your code is part of a larger project, navigate to your project directory. If it's a standalone file, save it as app.py.

2.  Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install Dependencies:

    Install the required libraries using pip. The torch installation specifically points to a CUDA-enabled version. Adjust cu118 to match your CUDA version if different (e.g., cu121).

    ```bash
    pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install diffusers accelerate streamlit
    ```

    -   Note on `torch`: If you do not have a CUDA-compatible GPU or encounter installation issues, you might need to install a CPU-only version of PyTorch, but expect significantly slower performance. Refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ "null") for specific installation commands based on your system.

üí° Usage
--------

1.  Run the Streamlit Application:

    Navigate to the directory containing your main.py file in your terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2.  Access the App:

    Your web browser will automatically open to the Streamlit application (usually at http://localhost:8501).

3.  Generate Videos:

    -   Enter your desired text prompt in the input box.

    -   Click the "Generate Video" button.

    -   The app will display a "Generating video..." message. This process can take several minutes depending on your GPU, internet speed (for model download), and the prompt complexity.

    -   Once generated, the video will appear on the page, and a "Download Video" button will be available.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
---------------------------

-   Performance: Video generation is computationally intensive. A powerful NVIDIA GPU with sufficient VRAM (e.g., 8GB+) is strongly recommended for reasonable generation times.

-   First Run: The first time you run the application, the model will be downloaded, which can take a while depending on your internet connection. Subsequent runs will use the cached model.

-   Video Length: The current setup generates a fixed number of frames per iteration (`num_iterations = 4`). You can experiment with this value in the code, but keep in mind that more frames will increase generation time and VRAM usage.
